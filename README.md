**Room:** [Junior Security Analyst Intro — TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/jrsecanalystintrouxo)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** *16 June 2025*

### 🎯 Objective  
Understand the daily responsibilities, tools, and workflow of a Junior Security Analyst (Tier 1 SOC). Learn how to triage alerts, escalate threats, and simulate real-world incident response activities in a SOC environment.

---

### 🗝️ Key Concepts  
- **SOC (Security Operations Center)** — A 24/7 team that monitors and responds to security threats.  
- **Triage** — Reviewing, classifying, and prioritising alerts based on severity.  
- **SIEM/EDR Tools** — Used to monitor logs, detect threats, and gather incident data.  
- **Incident Response** — Steps taken to contain, investigate, and remediate security breaches.  
- **Threat Intelligence (TTPs)** — Understanding attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures to stay ahead of threats.  
- **Escalation** — If the threat exceeds Tier 1 capabilities, analysts raise it to Tier 2 or a team lead.

### 🛠️ Tools Used  
- **Static Site Lab (TryHackMe simulation)** — Used to review alerts and simulate working in a SOC environment.  
- **Security Monitoring Dashboard** — Helped identify malicious IP addresses and take responsive actions.

---

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced  
- Had to carefully review alerts to spot the malicious activity — required attention to detail.  
- Learning when to escalate and how to investigate further was key.  
- Got the hang of the process by simulating a real SOC environment.

---

### 🧠 What I Learned  
- A Junior Analyst’s day often starts with reviewing tickets and alerts.  
- Found a malicious IP: `221.181.185.159` and escalated to **Will Griffin**.  
- Learned that threat actors sometimes leave messages behind — in this case: `THM{UNTIL-WE-MEET-AGAIN}`.  
- Practised responding to threats by blocking IPs and escalating incidents.

---

### 🌐 Real-World Application:  
> Junior Analysts are the front line of defence in any SOC. This role involves filtering out false positives, identifying real threats, and knowing when to pass it along. Every response counts toward protecting the business from harm.

---

### 💭 Reflections:  
- It felt rewarding to play through a realistic SOC scenario.  
- Getting to see how alerts turn into actions helped make the role feel more real.
